// the concept of virtual DOM
// Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM.
// When the state of the application changes, React updates the virtual DOM, and then efficiently updates the

// React is a Library and Anguler is Framework.

//Framework vs Library

// Framework is a full-featured solution that provides a lot of functionality out of the box.

// Library is a collection of reusable code that you can use to build your application.

// React is a library, it doesn't provide a lot of functionality out of the box, but
// it provides a lot of flexibility and customization options.

// Library is light-weight flexiblity


//React - it feels like a framework
